## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Off-centre focal radial gradients (SVG 1.1 §13.2.4 / PDF Type 3
  axial radial). `eval_radial_gradient` now solves the standard
  quadratic in `t` for the unique circle (centre on the focal→centre
  line, parameterised by `t`) that contains the sample point;
  degenerates correctly to the centred-radial formula when
  `focal == center`. SVG-mandated focal-clamp-inside-boundary is
  applied so the equation always has a real positive root.
- Bilinear image resampling for `Node::Image`. Selectable via
  `Renderer::image_filter: ImageFilter`; defaults to
  `ImageFilter::Bilinear` (matching CSS `image-rendering: auto` and the
  SVG spec). `ImageFilter::Nearest` retains the round-1 block-replication
  behaviour for callers that want pixel-perfect sprite rendering.
  Bilinear samples in premultiplied-alpha space and uses clamp-to-edge
  for the 2×2 footprint at texture boundaries. Lanczos2 is queued for
  round 3+.
- Bitmap cache for memoised group subtrees. When a
  [`Group`](oxideav_core::Group) carries `cache_key: Some(k)`, the
  rendered children are stored under `mix64(k, transform_signature)`
  so a re-render at the same effective transform returns the cached
  bitmap. Capacity-bounded LRU (default 256 entries; configurable via
  `Renderer::with_cache_capacity`); thread-safe behind `Arc<Mutex<…>>`
  so the cache survives `Renderer::clone()`. Cache hits / misses /
  occupancy are observable through `Renderer::cache_stats()`. Designed
  to consume scribe's `Group { cache_key: Some(deterministic_hash(face,
  glyph, size, subpixel)) }` glyph wrappers (#357).

### Initial release

- Initial release: pure-Rust vector→raster rendering kernel.
- Path flattening: quadratic + cubic de Casteljau subdivision; SVG
  elliptic-arc → cubic-Bezier conversion (Appendix F.6.5).
- Scanline AA fill: active-edge list, even-odd / non-zero rules,
  configurable 1/2/4/8× supersampling (default 4×).
- Stroke geometry: real offset polygon (not dilation) — Butt / Round /
  Square caps, Miter / Round / Bevel joins, dash pattern.
- Gradient evaluation: linear + radial, Pad / Reflect / Repeat spread.
- Single-path clip; group opacity; premultiplied-alpha composite onto
  an `Rgba` `VideoFrame`.
- `Renderer { width, height, supersampling, background }` + free
  `rasterize(&VectorFrame)` convenience function.
